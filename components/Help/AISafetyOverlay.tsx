          <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 max-h-[70vh] overflow-y-auto">
            <div>
              <h3 className="font-medium text-lg mb-2">1. Protect our privacy</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                <li>Do not submit personal information such as your social security number, your bank information, and more</li>
                <li>While this data is not being stored in the Cloud or used to train AI models, therefore we can submit some Davidson-specific data, be wary of giving very personal/secret information</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-medium text-lg mb-2">2. Do not rely solely on AI</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
                <li>AI can easily have information that is quite convincing but incorrect. So, be sure to fact-check with reputable sources (academic papers, government websites, reputable news outlets) and scholarly sources (Google Scholar or Davidson's library databases)</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-medium text-lg mb-2">3. Use AI ethically and do not plagiarize</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                <li>AI often uses the same words/phrases, or even copies complete blurbs from other sources to make their content. This means plagiarism is very possible, so stay vigilant and check your content</li>
                <li>If you do use AI content in your work, be sure to cite your sources</li>
                <li>Do not use AI to complete your assignments, write your essays, or make fake citations</li>
                <li>Be sure to check with your professor's policies on AI before you use it!</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-medium text-lg mb-2">4. Be aware of biases in AI models</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                <li>Because AI models are trained on man-made data, there can be biases and misinformation. As well, cultural, political, and ideological biases can be prevalent</li>
                <li>Stay cautious when you use AI for sensitive topics like history, politics, or social issues</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-medium text-lg mb-2">5. Choose reputable AI tools</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                <li>Stick with what is reliable and well-known... ChatGPT, Google Gemini, etc</li>
                <li>Avoid apps that request access to personal data and social media platforms</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3 className="font-medium text-lg mb-2">6. Balance AI with Real-World Learning</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                <li>While AI can be really awesome to expedite your work, it is important to continue to challenge yourself in learning</li>
                <li>Be sure to not use AI as a crutch, but as a tool to aid your work</li>
                <li>It is crucial to not lose your critical thinking and reasoning skills by leaving them out of practice</li>
              </ul>
